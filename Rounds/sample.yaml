    In this series I will be doing a music video round for 100 lanuages in order of total number of speakers


    [here](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-100-most-spoken-languages.jpg) is the full list 
    I will be using. 
    
    Maksing only indicates the language and not necessarily the location

  title: 'this is a title'
  answer: 23.234,123.2312325
  tolerance: 29.0
  url: google.com
  after: 'Full SP: [insert SP here]'

# check multiple coordinates
# instead of specifying 'answer' and 'tolerance'
#   you must now specify 'answers' and 'tolerances'
#   each coordinate in 'answers' must be in quotes
#   you must have as many tolerances as you have answers
# coords in guess can be in any order
# coords MUST be in decimal format
# # can be combined with the other options like manual or after
Example:
  title: give me 3 coordinates within 20m, 60m, 40m respectively in google maps decimal format
  answers: ['55.1894288,30.19891', '5.3539059,-1.3835478', '69.511346, 103.513381']
  tolerances: [20, 60, 40]

# add multiple rounds in rounds.yaml
# to do this, just put two rounds right next to each other like this:
round_1:
  title: 'foo'
  answer: 12.34, 56.78
  tolerance: 42.0
  url: google.com
round_2:
  title: 'foo2'
  answer: 12.34, 56.78
  tolerance: 52.0
  url: bing.com

# remember to save the file rounds.yaml

# rounds.yaml can be edited to add new rounds while the bot is running
# when rounds are loaded, they are removed from rounds.yaml saved to a file called archive.yaml
